# Textual

**An AI-powered rich text editor that transforms how you write and edit content.**

Textual combines a professional-grade rich text editor with OpenAI's GPT-4o to provide intelligent writing assistance. Unlike traditional AI writing tools that generate entire documents, this application focuses on precise, contextual editing within your existing content.

## ‚ú® What Makes It Special

### Intelligent Content Editing

- **Contextual AI Commands**: Ask the AI to edit specific paragraphs, add content at precise locations, or format selections
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Chat with AI while maintaining full control over your document
- **Tool-based Precision**: AI uses structured commands to make exact changes rather than rewriting everything

### Professional Writing Experience

- **Rich Text Editor**: Full-featured editor with markdown support, tables, lists, and formatting
- **Split-pane Interface**: Work with your document and AI assistant side-by-side
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Comfortable writing in any environment
- **Distraction-free**: Clean, modern interface that keeps you focused on content

### Developer-friendly Architecture

- **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js 15, Lexical editor, and Vercel AI SDK
- **Tool Calling**: Sophisticated AI integration using structured commands
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive linting
- **Performance-first**: Uses Turbopack for lightning-fast development

## üöÄ Why This Approach is Promising

### Beyond Simple AI Writing

Most AI writing tools either:

- Generate entire documents from scratch (losing your voice and style)
- Provide generic suggestions that don't understand context

Textual takes a different approach:

- **Precision Editing**: Make specific changes to exact locations in your text
- **Contextual Understanding**: AI sees your entire document for better suggestions
- **Incremental Improvement**: Enhance your existing content rather than replacing it
- **Collaborative Workflow**: You stay in control while AI provides targeted assistance

### Technical Innovation

- **Structured AI Commands**: Uses tool calling for precise, reliable text manipulation
- **Real-time Streaming**: See AI responses and changes as they happen
- **State Synchronization**: Editor and chat interface stay perfectly in sync
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new AI capabilities and editor features

## üîÆ What's Coming Next

### Enhanced AI Capabilities

- **Multi-model Support**: Integration with Claude, Gemini, and other leading AI models
- **Specialized Writing Modes**: Academic writing, technical documentation, creative writing assistants
- **Research Integration**: AI that can fact-check, add citations, and pull in relevant information
- **Style Consistency**: AI that learns and maintains your writing style across documents

### Advanced Editor Features
